      <p>Understanding how long your appliances are designed to last is one of the most practical things a Canadian homeowner can know. It shapes every repair vs. replace decision, helps you budget for future purchases, and determines whether a service contract makes financial sense.</p>

      <p>Our technicians have been repairing appliances across Toronto and the GTA since 2017. The lifespan figures we share below are informed both by industry data and by the real-world patterns we observe across thousands of service calls every year.</p>

      <div class="tip-box">
        <p><strong>Note on Canadian Conditions:</strong> Appliances stored or used in unheated spaces — garages, basements, or utility rooms in older homes — often see reduced lifespans of 20–30% due to temperature cycling stress on compressors, motors, and seals.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Why Washers Have the Shortest Lifespan</h2>

      <p>Washing machines tend to have shorter lifespans than other major appliances because they are mechanical workhorses: spinning heavy loads at high RPM, filling and draining with water multiple times per cycle, and doing so 200–400 times per year in an average Canadian household. The bearings, suspension rods, pump, and motor all experience continuous mechanical stress.</p>

      <p>Front-load washers tend to last slightly longer than top-loaders in our experience, but require more attention to door seal and pump filter maintenance. Ignoring these maintenance points can cut 2–3 years off their useful life.</p>

      <h2>Why Ovens and Dryers Last Longest</h2>

      <p>Gas ranges and chest freezers lead in longevity because they have relatively few moving parts. Gas ranges rely on burner igniters, control valves, and bake/broil elements — components that are robust and inexpensive to replace. Chest freezers have a single compressor with no defrost cycling stress.</p>

      <p>Dryers outlast washers largely because they move air and heat rather than managing water under pressure. The mechanical components — a motor, a belt, an idler pulley — are simple and inexpensive. Most dryer failures are heating-related and can be repaired for under $200.</p>

      <h2>Factors That Shorten Appliance Lifespan in Canada</h2>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Overloading:</strong> Running a washer or dryer beyond its rated capacity strains bearings and motors consistently.</li>
        <li><strong>Hard water:</strong> Toronto and GTA municipalities have moderate water hardness. Scale buildup inside dishwashers and washing machines accelerates wear on pumps and valves.</li>
        <li><strong>Neglected maintenance:</strong> Dirty fridge condenser coils, clogged dryer vents, and uncleaned washer pump filters all shorten lifespan noticeably.</li>
        <li><strong>Using wrong detergent:</strong> Using regular detergent in an HE washer produces excess suds that stress the machine's bearing seals over time.</li>
        <li><strong>Temperature extremes:</strong> Appliances in uninsulated garages experience summer heat above 35°C and winter cold below -10°C. This is hard on refrigerant, compressors, and control boards.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Factors That Extend Appliance Lifespan</h2>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Annual maintenance:</strong> Professional dryer vent cleaning, coil vacuuming, and drum/tub cleaning extend service life by 2–4 years on average.</li>
        <li><strong>Prompt repairs:</strong> Addressing small issues — an unusual sound, a minor leak, an occasional error code — before they cascade into major failures is the single highest-impact habit.</li>
        <li><strong>Appropriate usage:</strong> Running the dishwasher only when full, avoiding partial loads that trigger off-balance detection in washers, and setting the fridge to 37°F / 3°C rather than its coldest setting all reduce wear.</li>
        <li><strong>Quality of unit:</strong> Premium appliances from brands like Bosch, Miele, and KitchenAid typically outlast budget-tier models by 3–5 years in our field experience.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>When Does Appliance Age Affect the Repair Decision?</h2>

      <p>Knowing your appliance's age relative to its expected lifespan changes the calculus on repair versus replacement significantly. Our rule of thumb:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Under 50% of expected lifespan:</strong> Repair virtually any issue under $400 without hesitation.</li>
        <li><strong>50–75% of expected lifespan:</strong> Repair if the cost is under $250–$300. Avoid major component replacements.</li>
        <li><strong>Over 75% of expected lifespan:</strong> Evaluate carefully. Minor repairs may still be worthwhile; major component failures suggest replacement.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>For example, a 6-year-old dishwasher (67% through its expected 9-year lifespan) experiencing a pump failure at $220 is a reasonable repair. A 9-year-old dishwasher (100% of expected lifespan) with a failing control board at $300 is a tougher call — replacement may make more sense.</p>
