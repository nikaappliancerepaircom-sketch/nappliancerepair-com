      <p>Bosch dishwashers are consistently rated among the quietest and most reliable on the Canadian market. Their 44dBA sound ratings, third rack design, and reliable wash performance make them a top choice for Toronto kitchens. But like every sophisticated appliance, Bosch dishwashers have their own set of recurring problems that we see regularly across the GTA.</p>

      <p>Here's a practical breakdown of the most common Bosch dishwasher issues — what causes them, what you can check yourself, and when professional repair is the right call.</p>

      <h2>Problem 1: Error Code E15 — Flood Protection Triggered</h2>

      <div class="error-card">
        <div class="error-code">Error E15</div>
        <p>AquaStop anti-flood protection activated. Water has collected in the base pan of the dishwasher.</p>
      </div>

      <p>Bosch's AquaStop system uses a float switch in the base tray to detect any water accumulation that shouldn't be there. When water enters the tray — from an internal leak — the E15 code appears and the dishwasher locks out to prevent flooding.</p>

      <p><strong>First step to try:</strong> Tilt the dishwasher backward about 45 degrees (get help with this) and hold it for 30–60 seconds to allow any water in the base tray to drain toward the pump. Set it level again and run a short rinse cycle. If E15 doesn't return, the issue was likely a one-time overflow. If E15 returns consistently, there's an active internal leak — common culprits are a cracked hose, a faulty inlet valve, or a door gasket no longer sealing properly.</p>

      <h2>Problem 2: Error Code E24 — Drain Issue</h2>

      <div class="error-card">
        <div class="error-code">Error E24</div>
        <p>Drain fault — the dishwasher cannot drain water within the expected time window.</p>
      </div>

      <p>E24 is one of the most common Bosch error codes we encounter. Before calling a technician, check these three things:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Filter assembly:</strong> Remove the cylindrical filter in the bottom of the dishwasher tub and clean it thoroughly under running water. A clogged filter restricts drainage significantly.</li>
        <li><strong>Drain hose:</strong> Pull the dishwasher out slightly and confirm the drain hose running to your sink drain or garbage disposal isn't kinked behind the unit.</li>
        <li><strong>Garbage disposal knockout:</strong> If your dishwasher was recently installed alongside a new garbage disposal, confirm the knockout plug in the disposal's dishwasher inlet was removed. This is a frequently missed installation step.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If none of these resolve E24, the drain pump is likely failing. Bosch drain pump replacement costs $150–$240 in Toronto and is a professional repair — the pump is integrated into the sump assembly and requires dismantling the tub interior.</p>

      <h2>Problem 3: Dishes Not Coming Out Clean</h2>

      <p>This is one of the most common Bosch service calls we receive, and it's often solvable without parts replacement. Bosch dishwashers are calibrated for specific water temperatures and detergent types — when either is off, wash quality suffers noticeably.</p>

      <p><strong>Check these factors in order:</strong></p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Filter:</strong> A dirty filter is the most common cause of poor wash results. Bosch recommends cleaning it monthly.</li>
        <li><strong>Spray arm holes:</strong> Remove the upper and lower spray arms and check for clogged holes. Use a toothpick to clear any mineral deposits. In Toronto's hard water conditions, this can be needed every 3–4 months.</li>
        <li><strong>Rinse aid:</strong> Bosch dishwashers require rinse aid for proper drying and spot-free results. An empty dispenser dramatically affects wash performance.</li>
        <li><strong>Detergent type:</strong> Use only dishwasher-specific detergent in pod, gel, or powder form. Never use dish soap.</li>
        <li><strong>Loading:</strong> Overloading blocks spray arm rotation. Follow the loading guide in your manual.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="tip-box">
        <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Run your kitchen faucet hot before starting the dishwasher. This ensures the first fill of the cycle is hot water rather than cold water sitting in the pipes — especially important in cold Toronto winters when pipes take longer to deliver hot water.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Problem 4: Dishwasher Not Starting</h2>

      <p>A Bosch dishwasher that won't start at all — no lights, no response — usually points to a door latch issue rather than a control board failure. The Bosch door latch contains a microswitch that must make proper contact for the machine to receive the "door closed" signal and allow a cycle to begin.</p>

      <p>Check whether the door clicks firmly shut. If you hear the click but the machine still won't start, the microswitch inside the latch assembly may have failed. This is a $90–$160 repair. If the machine shows lights and responds to buttons but won't run a cycle, a control board fault is more likely — a more involved diagnosis.</p>

      <h2>Problem 5: Door Latch and Detergent Dispenser Issues</h2>

      <p>Bosch dishwasher door latches experience significant mechanical stress over years of use — especially in homes where the dishwasher door is dropped open rather than lowered gently. In addition to preventing the cycle from starting, a worn latch can allow steam to escape during the cycle and cause the door seal to degrade faster.</p>

      <p>The detergent dispenser is another common Bosch failure point. The spring-loaded latch that releases the dispenser door at the appropriate moment in the cycle weakens over time. If your detergent pod is still intact at the end of a cycle, the dispenser latch or door spring likely needs replacement — a $80–$120 repair.</p>
