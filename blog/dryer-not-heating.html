    <article class="article-body">

      <p>When your dryer spins but clothes come out cold and damp, the problem is isolated to the heating system — and that's actually good news. Dryer heating issues are among the most predictable and cost-effective appliance repairs we perform across Toronto and the GTA. In most cases, the fix involves replacing a single component for $80–$200.</p>

      <p>Here's a breakdown of the five most common causes, how to identify each one, and what the repair realistically costs at current Toronto labour and parts rates.</p>

      <h2>Cause 1: Blown Thermal Fuse (Most Common)</h2>

      <p>The thermal fuse is a one-time safety device that blows permanently when the dryer's internal temperature exceeds a safe threshold. Once blown, it cannot be reset — it must be replaced. It's a $5–$15 part, and a single-visit repair typically costs $80–$130 all-in.</p>

      <p><strong>Why it happens:</strong> The thermal fuse blows almost exclusively due to restricted airflow — meaning a clogged lint trap, a kinked or obstructed exhaust duct, or a blocked exterior vent cap. In Toronto townhouses and condos, long duct runs with multiple bends are a leading contributor.</p>

      <div class="warning-box">
        <p><strong>Critical:</strong> If you replace a thermal fuse without clearing the vent obstruction first, the new fuse will blow again — often within weeks. Always have the vent inspected as part of a thermal fuse replacement.</p>
      </div>

      <p><strong>Quick check:</strong> A blown thermal fuse can be confirmed with a multimeter set to continuity mode. A functional fuse shows continuity; a blown fuse shows none. The fuse is typically located on the exhaust duct inside the back panel of the dryer.</p>

      <h2>Cause 2: Burned-Out Heating Element (Electric Dryers)</h2>

      <p>Electric dryers generate heat by passing electricity through a coiled metal element — similar in principle to a toaster. Over years of use (typically 8–12 years), these elements burn out, particularly if the dryer is frequently run at maximum heat settings or if airflow has been restricted.</p>

      <p>Heating element replacement typically costs $120–$200 in Toronto, including parts and labour. The element itself ranges from $30–$80 depending on the brand and model. It's a moderately involved repair requiring removal of the dryer's drum, but our technicians complete it in under 90 minutes on most models.</p>

      <div class="cost-card">
        <span class="cost-card-label">Heating Element Replacement (Electric)</span>
        <span class="cost-card-amount">$120 – $200</span>
      </div>

      <h2>Cause 3: Failed Gas Valve Coil (Gas Dryers)</h2>

      <p>Gas dryers use electromagnetic valve coils to open the gas valve and allow fuel to flow to the burner. These coil sets — usually a pack of 2–4 coils — wear out over time and are a very common failure point on gas dryers that are 6 or more years old.</p>

      <p><strong>Symptoms specific to gas valve failure:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Dryer starts and ignites briefly on the first cycle but won't ignite on subsequent cycles (the igniter glows but the flame doesn't hold)</li>
        <li>Dryer starts but produces only lukewarm heat</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Gas valve coil replacement costs $100–$180 and is one of the more straightforward gas dryer repairs. It doesn't require disconnecting the gas line.</p>

      <div class="cost-card">
        <span class="cost-card-label">Gas Valve Coil Set Replacement</span>
        <span class="cost-card-amount">$100 – $180</span>
      </div>

      <h2>Cause 4: Restricted Airflow and Vent Blockages</h2>

      <p>A blocked dryer vent is both a cause and a consequence of heating problems. Even if the dryer technically produces heat, severe airflow restriction causes heat to build up inside the drum without effectively drying clothes — cycles become longer and clothes remain damp.</p>

      <p>Toronto homes built before 1995 frequently have rigid metal exhaust ducts that have accumulated decades of lint. Homes with flexible foil ducts — the accordion-style type — are particularly prone to crushing and internal lint buildup. Professional vent cleaning runs $80–$150 and is recommended annually for any Toronto home with a dryer.</p>

      <div class="tip-box">
        <p><strong>Fire Safety Note:</strong> Blocked dryer vents are the leading cause of residential dryer fires in Canada, according to the NFPA. If your clothes are taking more than one cycle to dry, suspect a partial vent blockage even if the dryer appears to be heating.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Cause 5: Cycling Thermostat Failure</h2>

      <p>The cycling thermostat regulates the heating element or gas valve, turning the heat on and off to maintain a set drum temperature throughout the cycle. A failed cycling thermostat often causes the dryer to run with no heat at all, or to heat only intermittently.</p>

      <p>Cycling thermostats are inexpensive ($15–$30) and relatively straightforward to replace on most models. The total repair runs $90–$150 in Toronto.</p>
