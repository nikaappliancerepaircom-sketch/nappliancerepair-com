    <article class="article-body">

      <p>A refrigerator that runs but fails to keep food cold is one of the most disruptive appliance failures a Toronto household can face. Our technicians have diagnosed this problem across thousands of homes throughout the GTA, and the good news is that most causes are identifiable and fixable — often without replacing the entire unit.</p>

      <p>Below we cover the seven most common reasons a fridge stops cooling, how to check each one yourself, and when it makes more sense to call a professional.</p>

      <h2>1. Dirty or Blocked Condenser Coils</h2>

      <div class="cause-card">
        <div class="cause-card-number">Cause 01</div>
        <h3>Condenser Coil Buildup</h3>
        <p>The condenser coils release heat from the refrigerant. When they're coated in dust and pet hair, the fridge can't expel heat efficiently — and cooling suffers. This is the single most common reason a well-functioning fridge gradually loses cooling ability.</p>
        <span class="diy-label diy-yes">DIY Friendly</span>
      </div>

      <p><strong>Fix:</strong> Locate the coils (usually behind a kick plate at the bottom front or on the back of the unit). Unplug the fridge, then use a vacuum with a brush attachment or a coil cleaning brush to remove dust. Do this every 6–12 months. Toronto homes with pets should clean coils every 3–4 months.</p>

      <h2>2. Faulty Thermostat</h2>

      <div class="cause-card">
        <div class="cause-card-number">Cause 02</div>
        <h3>Temperature Control Thermostat Failure</h3>
        <p>The thermostat tells the compressor when to run. If it's stuck or faulty, it may signal the compressor to shut off too early — or never turn on at all. You might hear the fridge running at normal volume yet find temperatures rising inside.</p>
        <span class="diy-label diy-yes">DIY Possible</span>
      </div>

      <p><strong>Check:</strong> Turn the thermostat dial from its current setting to the coldest setting. If you hear a click and the compressor starts running, the thermostat is likely fine. No click could indicate failure. Thermostat replacement is a $60–$120 DIY repair if you're comfortable with appliance internals.</p>

      <h2>3. Evaporator Fan Motor Failure</h2>

      <div class="cause-card">
        <div class="cause-card-number">Cause 03</div>
        <h3>Evaporator Fan Not Circulating Cold Air</h3>
        <p>The evaporator fan draws air over the evaporator coils and circulates cold air through the fridge and freezer compartments. When this motor fails, cold air stops moving — so the freezer may stay cold while the fridge section warms up noticeably.</p>
        <span class="diy-label diy-no">Call a Pro</span>
      </div>

      <p><strong>Signs:</strong> Freezer is at correct temperature but fridge is warm. You may hear unusual squealing or notice the fan has stopped spinning when you open the freezer door. Motor replacement typically costs $120–$180 in parts and labour.</p>

      <h2>4. Door Gasket Leak</h2>

      <div class="cause-card">
        <div class="cause-card-number">Cause 04</div>
        <h3>Worn or Torn Door Seal</h3>
        <p>A worn door gasket allows warm air to seep in constantly, forcing the compressor to work overtime. Over time, the fridge loses the temperature battle entirely. Gaskets crack and stiffen in Toronto winters particularly.</p>
        <span class="diy-label diy-yes">DIY Friendly</span>
      </div>

      <p><strong>Test:</strong> Close the door on a piece of paper. If you can slide it out easily, the seal isn't gripping. Replacement gaskets cost $30–$70 for most models and snap or screw into place without special tools.</p>

      <h2>5. Compressor Issues</h2>

      <div class="cause-card">
        <div class="cause-card-number">Cause 05</div>
        <h3>Compressor Failure or Relay Problems</h3>
        <p>The compressor is the heart of the refrigeration system. A fully failed compressor means the fridge cannot cool at all. However, before assuming the worst, check the start relay — a small clip-on component that costs under $20 and mimics compressor failure symptoms when it fails.</p>
        <span class="diy-label diy-no">Call a Pro</span>
      </div>

      <p><strong>Quick test:</strong> Remove the start relay from the compressor side and shake it. A rattle typically means it's failed. Replacing the relay is a DIY job. A failed compressor itself is a bigger repair ($280–$500) and usually warrants a professional evaluation of whether repair vs. replacement makes more sense.</p>

      <h2>6. Refrigerant (Coolant) Leak</h2>

      <div class="cause-card">
        <div class="cause-card-number">Cause 06</div>
        <h3>Low Refrigerant Level</h3>
        <p>Refrigerant doesn't deplete over time under normal circumstances — if levels are low, there's a leak somewhere in the system. Leaks are rare in properly maintained units but do occur, particularly in older refrigerators with copper tubing.</p>
        <span class="diy-label diy-no">Licensed Tech Required</span>
      </div>

      <p><strong>Signs:</strong> Fridge is warm despite the compressor running, frost pattern on evaporator coils is uneven or absent, or you notice an oily residue near coils or lines. Refrigerant handling requires EPA certification in Canada — this is not a DIY repair.</p>

      <h2>7. Defrost Drain Clog</h2>

      <div class="cause-card">
        <div class="cause-card-number">Cause 07</div>
        <h3>Blocked Defrost Drain</h3>
        <p>The defrost system periodically melts frost from the evaporator coils. The resulting water drains through a small drain tube to a pan below the unit. When this drain clogs — usually with food debris or ice — water backs up and freezes over the evaporator coils, blocking airflow entirely.</p>
        <span class="diy-label diy-yes">DIY Possible</span>
      </div>

      <p><strong>Fix:</strong> Unplug the fridge and locate the drain hole at the back of the freezer floor. Use warm water and a turkey baster to flush the drain clear, then follow with a small amount of baking soda solution to prevent future blockage.</p>

      <h2>When to DIY vs. When to Call a Professional</h2>

      <p>The table below summarizes which repairs are reasonable for a careful homeowner and which genuinely require a licensed technician:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>DIY appropriate:</strong> Cleaning condenser coils, replacing door gaskets, clearing defrost drain clogs, replacing start relay</li>
        <li><strong>Call a professional:</strong> Compressor diagnosis/replacement, refrigerant leak repair, evaporator fan motor replacement, control board issues</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="tip-box">
        <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> If your fridge is less than 8 years old and shows any of the symptoms above, repair is almost always the financially sound choice. A new comparable refrigerator in Toronto costs $900–$2,500. Most repairs run $150–$350.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="warning-box">
        <p><strong>Important:</strong> Before attempting any internal repair, always unplug the refrigerator and allow it to sit for 5 minutes to discharge capacitors. Never work on a running appliance.</p>
