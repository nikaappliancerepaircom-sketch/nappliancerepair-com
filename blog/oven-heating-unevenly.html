      <p>Uneven oven heating is one of those problems that sneaks up on you: cookies that burn on one side, cakes that dome unevenly, or roasting pans where one end of the meat is charred while the other end is still pink. For Toronto home cooks who take their baking seriously, this is a real quality-of-life issue.</p>

      <p>Our oven repair technicians have diagnosed this problem across hundreds of GTA homes. Here are the most common causes, how to identify which one applies to your oven, and what the typical fix involves.</p>

      <h2>Cause 1: Partially Failed Bake Element (Electric Ovens)</h2>

      <div class="diagnosis-card">
        <div class="symptom">Symptom</div>
        <h3>Visible Blistering, Dark Spots, or Breakage on the Element</h3>
        <p>The bake element is the curved heating element at the bottom of the oven cavity. When it partially fails — burning out at one section while remaining functional elsewhere — it produces uneven heat distribution across the floor of the oven. Food close to the failed section won't receive adequate radiant heat.</p>
      </div>

      <p><strong>How to check:</strong> With the oven off and cool, visually inspect the bake element for any visible blistering, holes, or areas where the element has changed colour or shape. A healthy element appears uniform and undamaged. A partially burned-out element often shows a visible gap or blister at the failure point.</p>

      <p>You can also observe the element during the first few minutes of preheating — it should glow uniformly red/orange across its entire length. Any section that remains dark or appears dimmer indicates a partial burnout.</p>

      <p><strong>Cost:</strong> Bake element replacement typically costs $120–$200 in Toronto, including parts and labour. The element itself is $30–$65 on most models, and replacement is straightforward on most ranges.</p>

      <h2>Cause 2: Faulty Temperature Sensor</h2>

      <div class="diagnosis-card">
        <div class="symptom">Symptom</div>
        <h3>Oven Runs Consistently Too Hot, Too Cool, or Erratically</h3>
        <p>The temperature sensor (also called the oven probe or RTD sensor) is a thin metal probe mounted at the top back of the oven interior. It continuously monitors the oven temperature and sends that data to the control board, which adjusts the element cycling accordingly. A failed sensor sends incorrect readings, causing the oven to overshoot or undershoot its target temperature.</p>
      </div>

      <p><strong>Confirming the issue:</strong> An oven thermometer (available for under $15) placed inside the oven during preheating is your first diagnostic tool. Set the oven to 350°F and check the thermometer after 20 minutes of preheating. If the actual temperature is more than 25°F off from the set point, or if it fluctuates widely (e.g., 330°F then 385°F), the sensor or control board warrants investigation.</p>

      <p>Technicians test sensor resistance with a multimeter. A properly functioning sensor reads approximately 1,080–1,100 ohms at room temperature. Out-of-range readings confirm sensor failure.</p>

      <p><strong>Cost:</strong> Temperature sensor replacement runs $100–$180 in Toronto, including labour. The sensor itself is typically $25–$60.</p>

      <h2>Cause 3: Convection Fan Failure or Reduced Performance</h2>

      <div class="diagnosis-card">
        <div class="symptom">Symptom</div>
        <h3>Uneven Results Only When Using Convection Mode</h3>
        <p>Convection ovens use a fan at the rear of the cavity to circulate hot air throughout the oven, eliminating hot spots and producing more even cooking results. When this fan motor begins to fail, it may spin at reduced speed or stop periodically — creating exactly the uneven heating pattern that convection mode is supposed to eliminate.</p>
      </div>

      <p><strong>How to check:</strong> With the oven in convection mode, listen for the fan from the front. You should hear consistent air movement. If it's noticeably quieter than usual, or if you can hear intermittent grinding or bearing noise, the motor is likely failing.</p>

      <p>Note: If results are uneven in bake mode (no fan) but fine in convection mode, this actually suggests the problem is with the bake element or sensor rather than the fan.</p>

      <p><strong>Cost:</strong> Convection fan motor replacement costs $130–$220 in Toronto. This requires accessing the rear of the oven cavity, which is more involved than other oven repairs but still typically completed in a single visit.</p>

      <h2>Cause 4: Temperature Calibration Drift</h2>

      <p>Oven thermostats and temperature sensors can drift from their original calibration over time, particularly on ovens that have experienced significant temperature cycling (multiple roasting sessions at 450°F+, self-cleaning cycles, etc.). The oven's set temperature and actual temperature diverge — and while this typically causes consistent under- or over-heating rather than spatial unevenness, it can compound the effects of other minor issues.</p>

      <p><strong>DIY calibration:</strong> Many modern ovens allow user-accessible temperature calibration through the settings menu. Consult your owner's manual for the calibration procedure — it typically involves holding two buttons simultaneously and adjusting the offset in 5°F increments up to ±35°F. This compensates for consistent temperature offset but won't correct spatially uneven heating.</p>

      <div class="tip-box">
        <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Rotate your baking pans halfway through the bake time as a temporary workaround for mild oven unevenness. This is standard professional bakery practice even with high-end deck ovens, because all ovens have some degree of natural temperature variation.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Cause 5: Burnt Food Spots on Oven Floor</h2>

      <p>An often-overlooked cause of perceived uneven heating: baked-on spills and burnt food residue on the oven floor absorb heat unevenly and can create localized hot zones. This is especially pronounced in self-cleaning ovens, where the residue often carbonizes into a hard, heat-absorbing layer.</p>

      <p>Before booking a service call, thoroughly clean the oven interior (or run a self-clean cycle on applicable models) and test baking results again. Many cases of "uneven heating" resolve after a proper cleaning.</p>
