      <strong>Quick Answer:</strong> F21 on a Whirlpool front-load washer means the machine failed to drain within the allowed time. The most common fix is cleaning the drain pump filter (bottom front access panel) — takes 5 minutes and costs nothing. If the error returns, the drain pump or pressure sensor likely needs replacement. N Appliance Repair fixes Whirlpool washers same-day in Toronto — call <a href="tel:+14375241053">(437) 524-1053</a>, available Mon–Sat 8am–8pm.
    </div>

    <p>The F21 error code (sometimes displayed as F21 E1) is one of the most common fault codes on Whirlpool Duet, Cabrio, and Maxima front-load washing machines. It indicates the washer could not complete a drain cycle within 8 minutes — resulting in a tub full of water, wet laundry, and a frustrated homeowner.</p>

    <p>The good news: in many cases the fix takes 5 minutes and costs nothing. In others, a component needs replacement. This guide walks through every possible cause of F21, what to check yourself, and what professional repair involves and costs in Toronto.</p>

    <h2>What Triggers the F21 Code?</h2>

    <p>Whirlpool's control board monitors how long the drain pump runs. If water has not drained after 8 minutes, the board stops the pump, displays F21, and locks the door to prevent flooding. This timeout is a safety feature — but it means the underlying issue can range from a clogged filter (easy fix) to a failed pump (needs replacement).</p>

    <h2>5 Causes of Whirlpool F21 — Diagnosis and Fix</h2>

    <div class="issue-card">
      <h3>1. Clogged Drain Pump Filter (Most Common)</h3>
      <p>All Whirlpool front-load washers have a pump filter that catches coins, hair, lint, and small items before they reach the pump impeller. Over time this filter clogs completely, blocking drainage. This is the #1 cause of F21 and is a homeowner-fixable issue.</p>
      <p><strong>DIY fix:</strong> Open the small rectangular access panel at the bottom front of the machine. Place towels on the floor. Unscrew the filter cap slowly — water will pour out. Remove all debris from the filter and cavity. Reinstall, run a drain-only cycle. If the F21 clears, you're done. Clean this filter every 3–6 months to prevent recurrence.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="issue-card">
      <h3>2. Kinked or Blocked Drain Hose</h3>
      <p>The drain hose runs from the pump to the standpipe or utility sink drain. If the washer was recently moved, the hose may have kinked. Lint and fabric softener residue can also accumulate and restrict flow over time. Check that the hose has no sharp bends and that the standpipe is not blocked (pour water down it to test flow). The hose standpipe should be inserted no more than 6 inches deep — too deep creates a siphon effect that causes drain failure.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="issue-card">
      <h3>3. Failed Drain Pump</h3>
      <p>If the filter is clean and the hose is clear but the washer still shows F21, the drain pump may have failed. Pump impellers can crack, the pump motor can burn out, or a foreign object (underwire, coin) can jam the impeller. A failed pump usually produces no drain noise during the drain cycle, or you may hear a humming noise without water movement. This requires professional repair — pump replacement costs $180–$280 in Toronto.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="issue-card">
      <h3>4. Faulty Pressure Switch (Water Level Sensor)</h3>
      <p>The pressure switch monitors water level in the tub via a small air chamber hose. If the hose is cracked or the switch malfunctions, the control board may incorrectly believe water is still present even after draining — triggering F21 even though drainage was successful. A quick check: if the washer drains audibly but still shows F21, the pressure switch or its hose is suspect. Pressure switch replacement in Toronto: $150–$230.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="issue-card">
      <h3>5. Control Board Fault</h3>
      <p>Rarely, the main control board itself misinterprets sensor data and incorrectly triggers F21. This is a diagnosis-of-exclusion — only suspect the board after all other causes have been ruled out. A board failure is more likely on machines over 8 years old or that have experienced power surges. Control board replacement: $280–$420 in Toronto, though refurbished boards can reduce this cost.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Step-by-Step: Resetting F21 After Clearing the Blockage</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Unplug the washer and leave it unplugged for 60 seconds.</li>
      <li>Plug it back in and press the Pause/Cancel button twice to clear the error.</li>
      <li>Select a drain or spin-only cycle and press Start.</li>
      <li>Monitor the cycle — if it completes without F21 returning, the issue is resolved.</li>
      <li>If F21 returns within 1–3 cycles, a component needs replacement.</li>
    </ol>

    <div class="tip-box">
      <strong>Tip:</strong> If you have a Whirlpool Duet manufactured 2008–2015, the drain pump filter is a known wear item that should be cleaned quarterly. Setting a calendar reminder is the easiest way to prevent F21 recurrence.
