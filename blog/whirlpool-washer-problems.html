    <article class="article-body">

      <p>Whirlpool is one of Canada's most popular washer brands — their top-load impeller models and Duet front-loaders appear in a significant portion of Toronto homes. After years of servicing Whirlpool washers across the GTA, our technicians have identified a consistent set of recurring problems tied to specific model generations and design features.</p>

      <p>This guide covers the five most common Whirlpool washer failures: what they look like, what causes them, and what the typical repair involves.</p>

      <h2>Problem 1: F7E1 Error Code — Motor Speed Sensing Fault</h2>

      <div class="error-card">
        <div class="error-code">Error F7E1</div>
        <p>Motor speed sensing error. The control board cannot confirm that the motor is spinning at the expected speed for the selected cycle.</p>
      </div>

      <p>F7E1 is among the most common error codes we see on Whirlpool top-load washers built between 2015 and 2022. When this code appears, the machine will typically stop mid-cycle, display the error, and refuse to continue.</p>

      <p><strong>Root causes:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Faulty motor control board — the most common hardware cause</li>
        <li>Failing Hall effect sensor on the motor (measures motor rotation speed)</li>
        <li>Wiring harness issue between the control board and motor</li>
        <li>Overloading the machine, which causes motor speed to drop below the expected threshold</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>First step:</strong> Unplug the washer for 60 seconds, then plug it back in and attempt a new cycle with a lighter load. If F7E1 returns consistently, the issue requires diagnostic testing with a technician — you cannot determine whether the board or sensor has failed without reading actual motor sensor data.</p>

      <div class="cost-card">
        <span class="cost-card-label">Motor Control Board Replacement</span>
        <span class="cost-card-amount">$180 – $320</span>
      </div>

      <h2>Problem 2: Lid Lock Failure</h2>

      <p>Whirlpool top-load washers use an electronic lid lock mechanism that must engage before spin and drain cycles can begin. This is a safety feature — preventing access to the spinning drum — but the lid lock assembly itself is a common failure point at the 4–8 year mark.</p>

      <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>The lid lock indicator light flashes or stays on continuously</li>
        <li>The washer fills but won't agitate, spin, or drain</li>
        <li>Error code F5E1 or F5E2 may appear (lid switch/lock errors)</li>
        <li>You can hear a faint clicking sound as the lock attempts to engage but fails</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>DIY check:</strong> Clean the area around the lid lock mechanism — sometimes lint and detergent residue prevent the striker from engaging the lock properly. With the washer unplugged, inspect the plastic striker tab on the underside of the lid for cracks or breaks. If the striker is intact but the lock still won't engage, the lock assembly itself needs replacing.</p>

      <div class="cost-card">
        <span class="cost-card-label">Lid Lock Assembly Replacement</span>
        <span class="cost-card-amount">$80 – $140</span>
      </div>

      <h2>Problem 3: Not Agitating or Low Agitation</h2>

      <p>On Whirlpool top-load washers with traditional agitators, a common complaint is that the agitator moves weakly or not at all — clothes come out less clean than expected, even after a full cycle.</p>

      <p>The most common cause is worn agitator dogs — small plastic cogs inside the agitator body that engage and disengage the agitator's ratcheting motion. When these wear out, the agitator spins freely in one direction without the characteristic back-and-forth wash stroke.</p>

      <p><strong>Test:</strong> Grab the agitator and try to turn it. In one direction, it should turn freely. In the other direction, it should resist with a click. If it rotates freely in both directions, the agitator dogs have failed. This is a $40–$80 DIY repair — agitator dog kits are available online and the agitator simply pulls off the spline shaft for replacement.</p>

      <p>On impeller-style Whirlpool washers (no agitator), weak wash performance is more often caused by a worn drive belt or motor coupling failure.</p>

      <h2>Problem 4: Washer Leaking Water</h2>

      <p>Water on the floor around a Whirlpool washer can come from several locations, and identifying the source is the critical first diagnostic step:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>From the front (front-loaders):</strong> Almost always the door boot seal. This large rubber gasket develops cracks, tears, or mould-weakened spots over time. Replacement costs $150–$230 and requires partial disassembly of the machine front.</li>
        <li><strong>From the back:</strong> Loose or cracked fill hose connections or a faulty water inlet valve that doesn't fully close between cycles.</li>
        <li><strong>From beneath the machine:</strong> A failing pump, a cracked tub bearing seal, or an internal hose that has deteriorated.</li>
        <li><strong>During or after the fill:</strong> Oversudsing from too much detergent creates foam that overflows the drum. Switch to HE detergent and reduce the amount used.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="tip-box">
        <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Front-load Whirlpool washers should have the door gasket (boot seal) wiped dry after every wash and the door left slightly ajar between cycles. This prevents the mould growth that weakens the seal from inside and is a leading cause of front-loader leaks in Toronto's humid summers.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Problem 5: Excessive Vibration During Spin</h2>

      <p>A Whirlpool washer that shakes violently during spin cycles is both alarming and potentially damaging to the floor, nearby cabinetry, and the machine itself. The most common causes are:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Unbalanced load:</strong> A single heavy item (like a comforter) on one side of the drum will cause severe vibration. Always distribute loads evenly.</li>
        <li><strong>Machine not level:</strong> All four feet must be in contact with the floor and level. Use a spirit level and adjust the feet accordingly. This is the most common cause of new-installation vibration.</li>
        <li><strong>Worn shock absorbers or suspension rods:</strong> These dampen drum movement during spin. When they wear out — typically at 6–9 years — even balanced loads vibrate severely. Shock absorber replacement costs $120–$200.</li>
        <li><strong>Worn drum bearings:</strong> A grinding or roaring noise during spin, in addition to vibration, points to drum bearing failure — one of the more expensive washer repairs at $280–$400.</li>
      </ul>
